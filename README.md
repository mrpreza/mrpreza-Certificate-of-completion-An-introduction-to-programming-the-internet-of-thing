An Introduction to Programming the Internet of Things (IoT)

This repository showcases my work and learning experience from the "An Introduction to Programming the Internet of Things (IoT)" specialization on Coursera, offered by UCI. The specialization covers embedded systems, the Raspberry Pi Platform, and the Arduino environment for building devices that interact with the physical world.

Specialization Overview

The specialization includes six courses:

Introduction to the Internet of Things and Embedded Systems

The Arduino Platform and C Programming

Interfacing with the Arduino

The Raspberry Pi Platform and Python Programming for the Raspberry Pi

Interfacing with the Raspberry Pi

Programming for the Internet of Things Project

In the final Capstone Project, I applied the skills learned to design, build, and test a microcontroller-based embedded system, producing a unique final project suitable for showcasing to future employers.

Key Learning Outcomes:

Arduino and Raspberry Pi Platforms: Learned how to use both platforms for building IoT devices.

Programming in C and Python: Gained practical programming experience on the Arduino and Raspberry Pi environments.

Project Design and Implementation: Designed and developed a fully functional IoT device as a capstone project, demonstrating my understanding of IoT systems and embedded programming.

Projects:

In this repository, you'll find code and documentation for the projects I worked on throughout the specialization:

Arduino-based IoT Device:

Designed and implemented a device that can interact with the physical environment.

Code for Arduino interfacing with sensors and actuators.

Raspberry Pi IoT System:

Built a Python-based system on the Raspberry Pi to handle IoT device operations.

Code for sensor integration and data transfer over the network.

Capstone Project:

A comprehensive project that demonstrates the practical application of IoT systems, integrating both Arduino and Raspberry Pi components.
