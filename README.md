# IoT Programming and Embedded Systems

This repository contains the code, documentation, and outcomes from my participation in the **"An Introduction to Programming the Internet of Things (IoT)"** specialization, offered by **University of California, Irvine** on **Coursera**.

## Specialization Overview

The specialization includes **six courses** that cover a wide range of topics on embedded systems, Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms, and the basics of programming for IoT devices:

1. **Introduction to the Internet of Things and Embedded Systems**
2. **The Arduino Platform and C Programming**
3. **Interfacing with the Arduino**
4. **The Raspberry Pi Platform and Python Programming for the Raspberry Pi**
5. **Interfacing with the Raspberry Pi**
6. **Programming for the Internet of Things Project** (Capstone Project)

### Learning Outcomes:

* **Embedded Systems Fundamentals**: Gained a strong understanding of embedded systems and IoT basics.
* **Arduino Platform**: Learned how to program and interface with the Arduino platform using C.
* **Raspberry Pi Platform**: Developed skills in Python programming for Raspberry Pi, including interfacing with sensors.
* **Capstone Project**: Designed and built an IoT-based system integrating Arduino and Raspberry Pi for a complete end-to-end IoT solution.

## Key Projects

1. **Arduino IoT Projects**:

   * Designed and implemented multiple IoT devices using Arduino, interfacing sensors and actuators to collect and transmit data.
   * Developed code for data acquisition and device control in C.

2. **Raspberry Pi IoT Projects**:

   * Implemented Python-based programs for data processing and communication with IoT sensors.
   * Built systems to send and receive data over the network using the Raspberry Pi.

3. **Capstone Project**:

   * In the final project, I applied the concepts learned to create a complete IoT system using both Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
   * The project involved designing a microcontroller-based system to control and monitor physical devices.

## Certificate of Completion
